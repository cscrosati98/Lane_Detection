# Lane_Detection
A simple lane detection algorithm developed using OpenCV and Python on Windows. This was a final product from my time doing research into autonomous and electric vehicles at the University of Pacific in Fall 2022.

NOTE: This is still in development, and is potentially buggy. This uses a combination of Canny Edge detection and Hough Lines to find yellow and white lanes in an image. This was originally created as a final project to demonstrate what I had learned when researching Autonomous Vehicles and their underlying algorithms/hardware. Given a longer timeline, I believe a majority of the bugs would be ironed out, as well as be able to work with live video feeds.
